  "Coucou Les Amis! My name is Isabella Hanqi Ding. I graduated from York University Digital Media program. Since then, I've been exploring the intersection of technology, creativity, and play.",
  "I originally come from Hainan Province, the southernmost island of China — a warm, tropical place filled with oceans, palm trees, and coconuts. Moving to Canada for university was like traveling from one end of the earth to the other, both in distance and temperature. This cultural and environmental shift has deeply influenced the way I see the world and design experiences.",
  "I started this blog to share the insights I learn every day. Most blogs focus on Game analysis, Game design, website design and interactive art, while others share the life lessons I've learned.",
  "When I'm not designing or coding, I'm making music (Logic Pro, Adobe Audition) or out with my camera capturing everyday stories."

    thoughts: `This project was a journey into narrative-driven game design. I wanted to create an experience that felt personal and immersive.
    
    The biggest challenge was balancing open-world exploration with a cohesive story. We solved this by creating environmental storytelling elements that players could discover at their own pace.
    
    Working with a team taught me the importance of clear communication and iterative design. Every week brought new insights that shaped the final product.`

    I used “Mapbox” to display the team's journey through each stadium and the match outcomes on the map. 
    The reason for choosing this dataset is that I am a fan of Manchester City but have never been to a live match, so I wanted to document their itinerary on the map. 
    For the overall color, I chose the blue color that represents Manchester City. The small boat in the middle is also a symbol of Manchester City. 
    When the mouse hovers over the small boat, you can view detailed information such as the exact competition date and results. `

    thoughts: `In this Java project, I created a simple card game that relies on probability. 
    Each player has a certain number of red and black cards, with different values. 
    The red cards can reduce the opponent's health points, while the black cards can increase one's own health points. 
    Drawing a blue card allows one to roll the dice again. Both players start with 100 health points.
    The player who loses all their health points first or whose health points are higher after five rounds wins. `

    Some place will gain while some will lose the marks. Characters could buy different skills and items that increases the amount of Hp in the shop (health drink). 
    At the end of each roll of the dice, the player will have a chance to choose one to attack. Players could choose to attack others or not, but the one who was chosen by other must accept.
