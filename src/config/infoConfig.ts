    thoughts: `This project was a journey into narrative-driven game design. I wanted to create an experience that felt personal and immersive.
    
    The biggest challenge was balancing open-world exploration with a cohesive story. We solved this by creating environmental storytelling elements that players could discover at their own pace.
    
    Working with a team taught me the importance of clear communication and iterative design. Every week brought new insights that shaped the final product.`
