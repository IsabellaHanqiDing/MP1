Señorita Extraviada, directed by Lourdes Portillo in 2001, employs various documentary modes to present the harrowing reality of crimes against women in Juarez, Mexico. The film incorporates elements of investigative journalism, testimonial interviews, and poetic storytelling to portray the distressing and urgent issue of the unsolved murders and disappearances of women in the border city. The documentary's narrative perspective is conveyed through a combination of the victims' voices, their families, and the filmmaker's own perspective. Lourdes Portillo effectively conveys the story and subject matter by adopting an empathetic and sensitive approach, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in the lives and struggles of the affected individuals. By utilizing different documentary modes and maintaining a compassionate voice throughout, the film effectively raises awareness and calls for action against the grave injustices faced by women in Juarez.


In the documentary "Señorita Extraviada," there are two key scenes that left a profound impact on me. First is the scene at the cemetery. In this scene, the film takes the viewers to the cemetery where many of the murdered women are buried. The camera slowly pans over the graves, and each tombstone bears the name and photograph of a victim, creating a poignant and powerful visual representation of the scale of the violence. The scene is accompanied by haunting music and the voiceover of the filmmaker, Lourdes Portillo. This scene serves as a memorial, humanizing the victims and giving them a presence in the film. It reflects the film's commitment to honoring the memory of the murdered women and evokes an affective and humanitarian response from the audience, urging them to confront the tragedy and violence faced by these women. Critically, this scene aligns with Sandell's argument about the film's ability to evoke the local and transnational factors that enable the violence against women in Juárez. By emphasizing the individuality of each victim and showing the vast number of graves, the scene confronts the audience with the scale of the problem and the urgent need to address it. It also connects the local forms of resistance and protest by displaying the collective memorialization of the victims, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging the work done by local and regional organizations in fighting the violence (Sandell, 463). Another scene that left a profound impact on me is the interview with mothers of the victims. Throughout the documentary, Portillo conducts interviews with mothers who have lost their daughters to the violence in Juárez. These interviews provide a platform for the mothers to share their pain, anger, and frustration with the lack of justice and accountability. One mother, in particular, shares a heartbreaking story of her daughter's disappearance and how the authorities dismissed her case without proper investigation. This scene is crucial in the context of Sandell's reading as it highlights the documentary's focus on the affective and ethical response to the violence. By giving the mothers a voice, the film acknowledges their agency in seeking justice and memorializing their daughters. It also challenges the reductionist approach that some narrative films have taken in depicting the border violence as solely a mystery or thriller. Instead, "Señorita Extraviada" centers the experiences and emotions of the affected families, emphasizing the human cost of the violence. Furthermore, this scene emphasizes the film's rejection of a reductive chain of substitutions, as Sandell discusses. By giving space to the individual stories and experiences of the mothers, the film resists seeing the violence against women as merely a symptom of a broader geopolitical issue and instead highlights the gendered forms of violation as part of the larger web of violence. The scene fosters a connection between the audience and the victims' families, urging viewers to recognize the urgency of the issue and the need for collective action (Sandell, 464). In conclusion, these key scenes from "Señorita Extraviada" exemplify the film's approach in evoking a broader network of geographical, historical, and economic forces that frame the violence against women in Juárez. They emphasize the affective and humanitarian response while also connecting the local and global dimensions of the issue. By memorializing the victims and giving a voice to the affected families, the film challenges the reductionist narratives often seen in other portrayals of the border violence and urges viewers to confront the urgency of the situation.


Through this documentary, I have come to realize the range of safety issues that women all over the world continue to face, not only in the past and present but also in the future. As an international student, I was previously aware of some incidents in my country where young women were trafficked to remote areas due to gender imbalances and forced to bear children for men, enduring captivity in the process. I assumed that certain Western countries might fare better in terms of women's rights compared to my own country. However, this documentary has enlightened me to the fact that women globally are confronting safety challenges, and even in cases where governments are involved, their inaction has resulted in a lack of proper management of women's safety issues. As revealed in the documentary, one female interviewee mentioned that successive governments have failed to address women's safety concerns adequately, leading to a higher level of danger faced by women in Mexico than I had imagined. One of the most poignant aspects that struck me in this documentary is the significant impact of geopolitical issues on personal security. As discussed both in the film and the assigned reading, the people, corporations, and legal systems on both sides of the US-Mexico border are contributing factors to the perpetuation of violence against women (Sandell, 463). This reminded me of some events that continue to occur on the China-Myanmar border. Certain criminal organizations deceive or kidnap young individuals from China to engage in illicit activities in Myanmar. However, due to geopolitical complexities, the Chinese authorities are unable to directly intervene in Myanmar to rescue these victims of illegal abduction. Consequently, the abducted individuals resort to posting videos online, seeking help and rescue through virtual means. These events bear resemblance to the transnational factors mentioned in the article that contribute to violence against women.
