In the contemporary media landscape, digital media plays a pivotal role in shaping societal attitudes and perceptions of marginalized communities, including transgender individuals. "Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen," directed by Sam Feder, addresses the representation of transgender lives in media. This article aims to analyze how "Disclosure" critiques trans representations and lives on screen, exploring the historical context and current state of trans portrayals. Drawing from two scholarly articles, Kanai and Dobson's (2016) "Digital media and gender" and Dill and Thill's (2007) "Video game characters and the socialization of gender roles," we will examine the impact of media representation on transgender visibility and empowerment. By examining the documentary's modes and presenting supporting arguments, this study seeks to enhance our understanding of the significance of trans representation in media.


"Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen" employs a range of documentary modes to effectively convey its message. Through a combination of expert interviews, archival footage, and personal testimonials, the film weaves together a comprehensive narrative that delves into the historical and contemporary portrayals of transgender individuals in media. This skillful utilization of documentary modes allows the film to present a nuanced perspective on the multifaceted experiences of trans lives and challenges prevalent societal norms surrounding gender and identity.


The documentary "Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen" sheds light on the historical discrimination against transgender individuals in traditional media, particularly in the film industry. One striking aspect of the documentary is the revelation that pioneering filmmaker D.W. Griffith played a significant role in perpetuating harmful stereotypes of transgender individuals in movies. Griffith's use of transgender individuals as ugly characters for comedic purposes laid the foundation for the negative portrayals and stereotypes that would persist in film for decades. This historical context, as depicted in the documentary, is significant as it highlights the deep-rooted bias and prejudice against transgender people in mainstream media. Griffith's portrayals reinforced negative societal perceptions of transgender individuals as figures of ridicule and deceit, further marginalizing and stigmatizing the transgender community. Such harmful depictions not only distorted the public's understanding of transgender lives but also influenced the development of media representations for generations to come. The impact of Griffith's early films is further underscored by the insights provided by Kanai and Dobson's (2016) research on digital media and gender. The article emphasizes how media, including films, can perpetuate and reinforce traditional gender norms, shaping societal attitudes and perceptions. In this case, Griffith's early use of transgender characters in demeaning roles contributed to the establishment of stereotypes that continued to haunt transgender representation on screen. Indeed, Dill and Thill's (2007) research on video game characters and the socialization of gender roles highlights the significant role that media, including video games, plays in the socialization of sexism. The media has the power to shape and reinforce societal norms and beliefs, including those related to gender. Through the portrayal of characters and narratives, media can perpetuate and normalize sexist attitudes and behaviors (Dill&Kathryn 1).


Another impressive aspect of this documentary is the discrimination against transgender individuals on variety shows. It involves sensationalizing the ways in which transgender people differ from the majority, treating them as something peculiar, and scrutinizing them as if they were circus animals. Even if they are not openly ridiculed in the traditional sense, simply treating them as different constitutes a form of discrimination. In interviews with transgender individuals, despite the hosts' attempts to be cautious with their remarks, they may still unintentionally offend the transgender interviewees with certain questions. This reflects that, as society progresses, even though there is an effort to treat transgender individuals with as much equality as possible, there is still a long way to go in achieving full equality for the transgender community. The portrayal of transgender people as peculiar or exotic on variety shows contributes to the dehumanization and objectification of the transgender community. As highlighted in "Disclosure," this kind of representation not only reduces transgender individuals to caricatures but also fosters a climate of othering and exclusion. Such portrayals reinforce the notion that transgender lives are somehow abnormal or outside the societal norm, fueling prejudice and discrimination. Even when the hosts on variety shows attempt to be cautious with their remarks, they may still inadvertently offend the transgender individuals they are interviewing. This speaks to the underlying issues of ignorance and insensitivity that persist in media interactions with transgender people. As a result, these interviews can perpetuate harmful narratives and contribute to the marginalization of transgender voices. This aspect of the documentary aligns with the research by Dill and Thill (2007) on the socialization of gender roles in media. The sensationalized portrayal of transgender individuals on variety shows reinforces gender norms and expectations, contributing to the socialization of sexist and discriminatory beliefs. Such representations perpetuate harmful attitudes towards transgender individuals, hindering progress towards a more inclusive and understanding society.


As an audience, I truly appreciate the powerful response of a transgender person in the documentary when faced with an interview: "I don't have to prove to anyone or myself that I'm a woman. I am a woman." This statement encapsulates the essence of self-acceptance, self-affirmation, and resilience that many transgender individuals embody in the face of discrimination and prejudice. It serves as a reminder that gender identity is an intrinsic part of one's being and does not require validation from others. The words of this individual in "Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen" carry significant weight, resonating with the ongoing struggle for transgender rights and acceptance. The journey towards embracing one's authentic self, especially in a society that may not fully understand or accept gender diversity, is a testament to the strength and courage of transgender individuals. This statement also echoes the research by Kanai and Dobson (2016) on digital media and gender, which highlights the importance of self-representation and autonomy in shaping one's identity. In the face of media portrayals that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes, transgender individuals have the agency to define and assert their gender identity on their terms. As a viewer, witnessing such a powerful and empowering moment in the documentary is a reminder of the importance of authentic representation in media. It underscores the significance of providing platforms for marginalized voices to tell their own stories, challenging harmful narratives, and promoting understanding and empathy.  As a student of digital media game art, "Disclosure: Trans Lives on Screen" has had a profound impact on my perspective and approach to game design. This documentary has been an eye-opening experience, exposing the discrimination and harmful representations faced by transgender individuals in various media forms, including video games. It has prompted me to reflect on the responsibility I hold as a future game creator and the role I can play in promoting positive change.  Through this documentary, I have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of respecting and representing transgender people in a fair and authentic manner in the games I design. It has taught me that games, like any other form of media, have the power to influence perceptions and shape societal attitudes. Therefore, I aspire to be mindful of the impact my creations may have on players and the broader community, especially in the context of gender representation. I am committed to creating games that embrace diversity and inclusivity, where all players can see themselves represented and feel valued. I aim to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or using transgender characters as mere plot devices or tokens. Instead, I want to craft narratives that showcase the richness and complexity of transgender experiences, acknowledging the diversity within the community and providing authentic and empowering portrayals. Furthermore, this documentary has inspired me to advocate for a more inclusive and non-discriminatory gaming industry. I hope to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share a commitment to challenging prejudice and promoting social progress through gaming. By actively supporting diverse voices and perspectives in the development process, we can create games that resonate with a wider range of players and contribute to a more empathetic and understanding society.


"In conclusion, this documentary stands as a powerful testament to the significance of media representation in shaping societal attitudes towards transgender individuals. Through a critical analysis of the documentary's utilization of various modes and the support of Kanai and Dobson's (2016) study on digital media and gender, as well as Dill and Thill's (2007) research on video game characters and gender roles, we gain a deeper appreciation for the struggles faced by trans individuals and the profound impact of media depictions on their visibility and empowerment. "Disclosure" not only critiques the historical media context that perpetuated harmful stereotypes and limited trans representation but also highlights the slow but positive progress in challenging traditional cisgender narratives. However, the documentary also emphasizes the persisting issues of tokenism and limited representation, calling for more authentic and diverse portrayals. As viewers, we are enlightened on the significance of diverse and accurate representation in challenging harmful stereotypes and promoting positive change. "Disclosure" has transformed our awareness, inspiring us to advocate for a more compassionate and equitable society that celebrates and embraces the diversity of trans lives. As scholars, viewers, and activists, it is incumbent upon us to continue to challenge harmful media depictions and actively promote visibility and empowerment for transgender individuals in the ever-evolving digital media landscape. Through collective efforts, we can create a media landscape that fosters understanding, empathy, and acceptance, ensuring that trans voices are heard and valued, and that their stories are authentically and respectfully represented.
