# The Radical Form and Reactionary Content of Busby Berkeley's Musical Numbers in Gold Diggers of 1933: Examining Sexism in Relation to the Film's Narrative

*By Isabella Hanqi Ding*

Busby Berkeley's musical numbers in Gold Diggers of 1933 are celebrated for their groundbreaking form, challenging the conventional use of cinematic space and time. 
However, these visually captivating sequences also exhibit elements of sexism, objectifying and containing the female body. 
This essay aims to critically examine whether the sexism found in Berkeley's numbers is supported by the film's narrative. 
By considering the insights provided by Pamela Robertson's course kit article, as well as class lectures and personal reflections, this analysis will evaluate the relationship between the film's narrative and the objectification of women within Berkeley's musical numbers.

Gold Diggers of 1933 intertwines narratives that both reinforce and challenge sexist notions, providing a nuanced examination of gender dynamics. The film revolves around struggling showgirls and their relationships with men. While some female characters are depicted as independent, ambitious, and witty, their pursuit of romance and financial stability becomes a central focus. This narrative element aligns with the objectification present in Berkeley's musical numbers, suggesting a correlation between the film's story and the perpetuation of sexism. In the opening musical number We're in the Money of the film, the scene is set on a central stage, and all the show girls are dressed in costumes made of shimmering coins. These costumes cover only the breasts and groin area with large coins, resulting in a sexy and revealing look for the dancers. “We’re in the Money, which visually links female sexuality and money, establishes the dual commodification of women and money (Robertson, 2002)”. Here, women are associated with money, and the act of displaying money through the female body objectifies it for the male gaze. The provocative dance moves further emphasize the sensual nature of these performances. At the same time, the lyrics sung by the show girls also emphasize their desire for money and greed for material possessions. As a result, the objectification of women's bodies from the male perspective is further amplified in the narrative. This is particularly evident when the police arrive to confiscate the costumes of the troupe, and the police officers violently tear off the coin props that cover the dancers' bodies. This action further highlights the influence of the prevailing societal perceptions at the time, as male police officers feel entitled to make such disrespectful gestures towards female showgirls. Although the showgirls display discomfort in response to this offensive action, they do not engage in substantial resistance but rather express concern about losing their jobs. This also reflects the impact of the Great Depression, which led to the closure of various industries and resulted in material scarcity for many women, thus creating the underlying premise for their desire for money. The film also conveys a message that women should pay particular attention to their attire, as it is the only way to leave an impression and secure employment. Carol mentions that she and the other girls need to wear "smart" clothes to make a lasting impression on producers and land acting jobs. Women in the film are also seen wearing hats and gloves when they go out. These aspects reflect women living under the male gaze, where women feel the need to dress themselves up to be more appealing to men in order to obtain more things, whether it be desired items or job opportunities.

The song Pettin' in the Park in the film best exemplifies the state of women under the male gaze. After the sign "for little girls who have to walk home" appears, when the actress misses the time to walk with the other girls, she whistles and trying to get the attention of other girls, but instead attracts a line of men who stare at her with an uncomfortable gaze and laugh when she walks away with her head down. These actions are disrespectful towards women and do not treat them as equals but rather as objects from the male perspective. The scene then transitions from the perspective of children playing with a ball to female dancers lying on male dancers in the park. They wear semi-transparent dresses on the lower half of their bodies and sway back and forth while kicking their legs. This action carries some sexual implications. The implication reaches its peak after the rain, when the curtain is lowered, and the actresses begin changing clothes directly on the stage. The backlighting allows the audience to easily see the outline of their bodies, leaving room for the male viewers' imagination. The role of the child actors on the stage is to represent the true desires within the male characters' minds, which is to pull back the curtain that obstructs the actresses' bodies. Afterwards, the female dancers all wear skirts made of metal. This demonstrates the resistance and desire to fight against the male gaze. However, when the child actor hands a pair of pliers to a male dancer and he forcibly opens the actresses' clothing, this resistance is completely defeated. From this scene, it can be observed that in a male-dominated society, it is difficult for women to resist and maintain an equal status with men. Even though on the surface they may appear equal, for example, when the actress gets off the car and is guided by a female police officer, or when they attempt to wear skirts made of metal that cannot be directly touched by men, it is still not enough to prevent them from living under the male gaze. Men can easily walk behind them and scrutinize them, even using pliers to open their clothes.

From another perspective, Gold Diggers of 1933 does showcase moments in its narrative that depict women asserting their rights and resisting patriarchal control. When the male protagonist's brother Lawrence dismisses his brother's desire to marry a showgirl, considering them all to be after money, the female protagonist's friends Carol and Trixie express their dissatisfaction with his behavior and seek to teach him a lesson. Their approach involves using their femininity and physical appearance as leverage, demanding that Lawrence and Faneuil buy them hats and corsages before they agree to go out with them. It may appear that women are controlling the actions of men in this scenario, but for these women, their bargaining chip is their own appearance. They resort to leveraging their appearance to gain opportunities to exert influence over men. Sadly, their physical appearance becomes their sole leverage in power struggles within a male-dominated world.

Moreover, there are many scenes that depict the female characters' desire for money and how they view this behavior as shameful in the film. For example, when Lawrence mistakes Carol for Poly, he attempts to bribe her to leave his brother and remarks, "Disgrace the family by marrying a showgirl." He compares showgirls to "parasites," "chiselers," and "gold diggers." These impressions are all images portrayed by women on stage from the male perspective. Upon learning about this, Carol becomes furious and, upon Trixie's suggestion, seeks to make Lawrence pay the price. However, somewhat ironically, their method of revenge is to make him pay for the hats and brooches they have acquired. This act of seeking gifts from men based on their appearance only serves to reinforce Lawrence's impression of showgirls. Even though Trixie portrays a gold digger in the film, her actions exaggeratedly showcase their desire for money. “They exaggerate their desire for material goods - Trixie, for instance, catches sight of Faneuil’s lighter and  exclaims ‘GOLD!’(Robertson, 2002)”. Even when Carol admits her love for Lawrence towards the end, she still sees herself as a corrupting force, describing herself as vulgar and cheap. The editing in this scene is ambiguous, and the audience cannot truly determine whether Carol loves Lawrence for his money or for who he is as a person. Regardless of the motive, the film depicts the existence of women's desire for money and their willingness to exchange their bodies for male financial support.

However, the main storyline of the film revolves around female characters, and the women in the movie are also making efforts to break stereotypes and challenge the male gaze. They depict a group of women striving to survive in the backdrop of the Great Depression. “With its emphasis on female leads in the primary diegesis and its reliance on feminine spectacle in the secondary diegesis, Gold Diggers of 1933 belies theories that presume an organizing male spectatorial address in all classical Hollywood films”(Robertson, 2002). The film's main plot revolves around several women and their lives, highlighting the thoughts and perspectives of women during that time. For example, at the beginning of the film, there are scenes where the female characters discuss how to approach job interviews and make bets on the types of cars they will see when they open the window. As the story progresses, the women support and assist each other in finding their own romantic partners. These narrative elements are predominantly presented from the female perspective, emphasizing the experiences and viewpoints of women in the film. Especially the love between Poly and Brad, despite Poly being the most naive among the female characters, their relationship is the most sincere in the entire film. Even when Poly is warned by her friends that the money Brad brought to sponsor the show might be stolen, and that he could potentially be a criminal, Poly doesn't give up on him but chooses to stay with him. Poly proves through her actions that not all showgirls are solely focused on money.

Furthermore, Gold Diggers of 1933 incorporates a self-reflexive element by blurring the lines between reality and performance. The narrative and musical numbers in the film are often in a state of separation, providing the audience with a mixture of escapism and surrealism. It caters to the expectations of the audience during the Great Depression, as they sought to escape the gloomy reality through elements of romance and comedy. The opening sequence, where the show is interrupted by the police raid, creates a meta-commentary on the precariousness of the entertainment industry during that time. Producers, screenwriters, and female actors all faced poverty and unemployment, resonating with the audience. This blending of fiction and reality adds depth to the narrative and invites viewers to question the social and economic conditions depicted in the film. The closing song Remember My Forgotten Man in the film further reflects the post-war situation and societal conditions. The musical number portrays soldiers heading to the battlefield and depicts the post-war struggles of unemployment, poverty, and broken families. Simultaneously, this scene also reinforces the strong prevailing belief of that time that women need to depend on men for happiness. In this segment, women of different age groups are shown alone: young women on the streets, married women in their rooms, women holding their children alone, and elderly women sitting in rocking chairs. These portrayals reflect the societal turbulence and the predicament faced by women after the war. However, the lyrics of the song state, "Cause ever since the world began, a woman's got to have a man," suggesting that despite being sung by women, the content expresses women's need for men. In the final song "Remember My Forgotten Man," the film also showcases a representation of the female perspective. Unlike the purely male-centered musical numbers, this performance places women in the center stage, allowing them to sing out their own voices in front of a group of men. “It delegates men to the role of mass spectacle and grants a woman both voice and empowered vision; the forgotten men will be produced and thus remembered by Carol’s ‘wailing’ song”(Robertson, 2002).

In conclusion, Gold Diggers of 1933 distinguishes itself through its narrative techniques. The film incorporates elements of social commentary and satire, challenging the conventional storytelling approaches prevalent in the era. It addresses the social and economic realities of the Great Depression, presenting a critique of the capitalist system and the power dynamics between the upper class and the working class. From a gender perspective, this film is indeed contradictory, and this contradiction arises from the developmental state of society at that time and the awareness of women's rights. “Gold Diggers of 1933 also offer a two-sided view of women, which both supports and critiques the notion that women’s only capital is their bodies”(Robertson, 2002).  While the film depicts moments of female empowerment and resistance to patriarchal control, it also perpetuates sexist ideologies through its underlying narrative and the objectification of women in Berkeley's musical numbers. The film's unique storytelling approach challenges the norms of its time and offers a nuanced portrayal of gender dynamics and the socio-economic realities of the Great Depression. Viewed from a contemporary standpoint, it is evident that this film contains numerous instances of gender discrimination and the objectification of women. Considering the societal context of its time, it is notable that the film provided opportunities for women to express themselves independently and offered a female perspective on the social conditions of that era. The fact that women were given a platform to sing out their thoughts and emotions amidst a group of men was indeed a rare occurrence. It is important to acknowledge both the limitations and the progressiveness within the film, taking into account the prevailing societal norms and the opportunities it provided for women's voices to be heard.
