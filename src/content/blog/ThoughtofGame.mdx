# My Game Design Ideas — How I Think About Games

*By Isabella Hanqi Ding*

> Purpose: I want to explain my basic ideas about game design and show how they connect to **my game idea** (working title TBD).

## 1) Gameplay is the core

For me, the fundamental of game design is **gameplay**. Without impressive gameplay, a game will **lose its spirit**. Visual expression, storytelling, and background music are important and cannot be ignored. But a **complete and playful** gameplay is the most important part that leads players to continue playing. A good art style makes players want to try the game; **good gameplay makes them want to stay**.

## 2) Simple functions, expandable depth

For good gameplay, I believe the **function of play should be as simple as possible**. Based on this simple function, it can **change and improve**. I like games where players learn the basics quickly and then discover more possibilities over time.

Just like *The Legend of Zelda*: the basic controls and main goals are clear and easy to understand, but the player&apos;s **controllability and freedom** are very high. This makes the game both easy to understand and enjoyable.

## 3) A game should illustrate a world

A good game should **show a world** to players. It should give a **sense of immersion**—a feeling of being there. The things that allow players to fully immerse themselves are the **interaction** between the player and the world, the **music**, and even their **combination**. These are key factors that decide whether a game can reach a new level.

## 4) Games: the sum of arts, built on gameplay

I believe that games can be seen as the **sum of art forms**, with **gameplay** added. Art and music mainly **enhance immersion** and **serve gameplay**. If a game is like a building, then gameplay is the **foundation**; the artistic parts are the **structures** built on top. No matter how magnificent the building is, if the foundation is weak, you can only look at it—you cannot live in it.

## 5) Games can bring unique thoughts to players

A good game can also bring **new thoughts** to players. By experiencing different perspectives of life or situations, different players will get **different answers** from the game. These answers are not right or wrong. They simply give players **new ways to view the world**.

## How this guides *my game idea*

When I design **my game idea**, I use these points as my checklist:

* Keep the **core play simple** and fun first.
* Let depth come from **how actions combine with the world**, not from more buttons.
* Build **immersion** through interaction and music, so the world feels alive.
* Use art and audio to **serve readability and feeling**, standing on the foundation of play.
* Leave **space for players** to discover their own ideas and answers while they play.

> Working title: **Crossing Forest** (final name to be decided). I will continue to update this article as the design grows, but these five ideas will stay as my base.
