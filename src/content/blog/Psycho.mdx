As the fast-paced music in the movie's opening stops, the screen gradually fade in, which become brighter, and the image of a city slowly became clear on the screen. The overall appearance of the entire city is showcased through a long take, with the camera positioned at a specific location and panning from left to right. As the screen moves, numerous skyscrapers, cars on the streets, and construction sites come into view, portraying the bustling scene of the city of Phoenix. At this moment, subtitles slide in from both sides of the screen simultaneously and come to a stop in the middle, displaying the location of the scene. Subsequently, as the screen continues to move, the visuals transition using the dissolve technique to depict different areas of the city. During this transition, subtitles appear in the same style as the location, revealing the date and time of the unfolding events. Following that, as the camera gradually moves, it ultimately zooms in a house. As the scene transitions through the dissolve effect, the camera starts with an overhead shot of a window in this house. Then, the camera zooms in closer to a window with partially drawn curtains. Immediately after, the scene cuts to another angle, approaching the room from a perspective parallel to the window. At this point, the focus of the camera shifts from outside the window to the interior of the room, and then it moves to the right. Initially, there is dim lighting and a faint glimpse of the room. However, as the camera moves toward the right, the lighting gradually increases, revealing a man getting dressed and a woman lying on the bed within the frame. This sequence, transitioning from outdoors to indoors, utilizes various filming techniques effectively, providing a clear depiction of the time and location in which the upcoming story unfolds. It succinctly presents the urban environment and the characters' surroundings to the audience within a short period. Additionally, this scene is accompanied by a background music piece featuring slow-paced but progressively increasing volume and pitch in string instruments, creating a tense and mysterious atmosphere.


As the male character speaks, the background music gradually fades, signaling the completion of the background introduction and the formal beginning of the story. The camera follows the male character's question about lunch and cuts to an untouched glass of water and food on the bedside table. When the female character responds, the shot switches to a medium shot distance, with the male character positioned in the center of the frame. The female character, with a rising motion, moves from the bottom right corner of the frame to the center. As the male character transitions from a standing position to sitting on the bed, the camera also moves downward, keeping him consistently in the center of the frame. When both characters transition from sitting to lying down on the bed, the camera continues to move downward with their motion and then starts moving to the right until it stops behind the female character. Throughout this sequence, the male character remains in the center of the frame, indicating that the camera movement tracks him in this particular segment. In this scene, there is no background music, only the dialogue between the two characters and the sound of their kissing, which highlights the special and discreet nature of their relationship. From a lighting perspective, the entire scene is illuminated only by the overhead light above the characters' heads. Initially, as the male character dresses, he is in a back-lighting state, with the light casting his body's shadow onto the female character's body, creating a sense of male dominance over the female. On the other hand, the scene also reveals a switched-off table lamp in the room, indicating that their relationship is kept secret and they prefer not to be discovered by others.


After the male character rejects the female character's proposal of marriage, the female character sits up on the bed, and the camera movement begins to track her as she walks towards the dressing table. At this point, the two characters are positioned on opposite sides of the frame, indicating that their relationship has become less intimate due to the disagreement about marriage. The camera maintains a medium shot distance, allowing the audience to better observe the interaction between the characters and the environment. The partially open curtains in the background of the room can be interpreted as symbolizing the tension in their relationship, with one party desiring marriage while the other does not. When the male character moves from the bed to the chair and makes disrespectful remarks about the female character's mother, the camera starts to focus shallowly on the female character. Subsequently, background music begins to play, indicating a growing sense of tension between the two characters. As the male character begins to express his reasons for not wanting to get married, the camera starts to track him, while the female character exiting from the frame. Later, when they argue about the marriage issue, the camera cuts back and forth between them, conveying a sense of tension and depicting their conflicting positions. When the female character makes her final attempt to convince the male character to marry her, the camera returns to the partially open curtains, indicating that their relationship remains undisclosed. However, after the male character rejects her, he exits the frame, and the camera begins to zoom in on the female character's face, capturing a long shot that displays her disappointed expression due to the inability to marry her beloved. In this scene, both actors exhibit similar body gestures, but they demonstrate contrasting attitudes towards marriage. While the male character pulls back the curtains and engages in conversation, his hands friction against the curtain ropes, suggesting his contemplation of sustaining the relationship without marriage. Conversely, the female character nervously rubs her hands against the collar of the male character's shirt as she makes her final plea for marriage, reflecting her unsettled emotions tinged with a glimmer of hope.


At the conclusion of the entire sequence, as the female character walks from the dressing table towards the door, the camera continues to track her movement. This camera movement effectively conveys her sense of disappointment and discontentment towards the male character due to their inability to marry. Her body gesture also evolves throughout the scene, transitioning from an initial inclination to approach the male character to eventually crossing her arms in front of her, rejecting any physical embrace. This transformation in her body gesture signifies a shift in her emotions and the evolving dynamics between her and the male character. In this segment, the background music is relatively gentle yet tinged with a sense of sadness. 


In general, the scene extensively utilizes medium shots, allowing the audience to clearly observe the emotional changes between the two characters and the details of the entire setting. For instance, there is a continuously rotating fan in the background at the beginning of the scene, indicating the hot weather at the time. The lighting evolves as the narrative progresses, starting with a single beam of light overhead when the characters wake up, and later, during their argument, the male character pulls back the curtains, illuminating the entire room. This change in lighting is significant and contributes to the progression of the plot, shifting from the initial ambiguous atmosphere between the characters to scenes of dissatisfaction with each other. Regarding sound, the dialogue scenes in the film utilize minimal background music. There are only a few instances where background music is employed during specific dialogue moments to enhance the atmospheric mood of the narrative.
